# Early-stopped mirror descent for noisy sparse phase retrieval
Code for the paper ["Nearly Minimax-Optimal Rates for Noisy Sparse Phase Retrieval via Early-Stopped Mirror Descent"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03678) 

This repository contains our implementation of early-stopped mirror descent and the code used to run the experiments in the paper.
